# Flexon and Bison

## What are?

Flex and Bison are tools for building programs that handle structured input. They were
originally tools for building compilers, but they have proven to be useful in many other
areas.

Formally, they implement Look-Ahead-Left-Right (as opposed to "recursive descent") parsing of non-ambiguous context-free (as opposed to "natural language") grammars.
